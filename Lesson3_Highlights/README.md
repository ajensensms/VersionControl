## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One concept we learned is the applicability of Verson Control Systems and how they offer users the ability to better manage, edit, and recover information.
2. Another concept we learned is how Git uses screenshots to store information instead of list of file-based changes
3. Lastly, we learned the three stages of Git committed, modified, staged.  Committed means the file is securely stored in a local repository.  Modified means that the file the file has changed but has not yet been committed to the local database just yet.  Staged means that one has marked the modified file in its current version to go to the next commit snapshot.
