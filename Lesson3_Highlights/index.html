            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records all changes to a file or a set of files.  This gives users the ability to better edit, control, and double check their work.  For people who manage many files, such as graphic designers and web designers, this system gives them the potential to keep and return back to previous versions of their work; with a version control system one can return to the beginning file after years of working on it.  With little effort, version control systems allow people to compare changes throughout time, see who modified what, who introduced any issues, and recover lost files.  This topic is extremely relevant to class as since we will be dealing with large files, this will give us the ability to manage large files much easier.

                <span class="text-muted">How Git Came To Be</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub first began as a large open source software project called Linux kernel.  Things changed however when they switched from passing software changes through patches and instead began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002.  There was a rough patch in 2005 when the commercial company as well as the community that helped developed Linux Kernal fell apart and lost the free-of-charge status.  This encouraged the Linux kernel elopement community to create their own tool using key aspects they learned when working with BitKeeper such as a simple design, speed, strong support, full distribution, and the ability to handle large projects.  I found this quite interesting due to the extreme evolution the system went through to get where it is currently.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While most version control systems store information as a list of file-based changes, Git Hub approaches this quite differently.  Other Version Control Systems, such as CVS, Subversion, Perforce, and Bazaar, compartmentalize their information as a set of files and the alterations made to each file over time.  However, Git approaches its information as more of a set of snapshots of a miniature file system.  When one commits a file or saves the file to a project in Git, Git essentially screen caps a picture of what all the files look like at that moment and then store this snapshot.  If the file has not changed, Git doesn't store the file and instead just links to the previous identical snapshot.  I find this really interesting due to the extreme efficiency of Git and its uniqueness when compared to its competition.

                <span class="text-muted">Committed, Modified, Staged</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A large feature of the Git system is the three main states that a file can reside in, committed, modified, staged.  Committed means the file is securely stored in a local repository.  Modified means that the file the file has changed but has not yet been committed to the local database just yet.  Staged means that one has marked the modified file in its current version to go to the next commit snapshot.  I find this very important information especially to our class because it is essential when attempting to utilize Git.  Without fully understanding this information one could not properly use Git.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Directory, Working Tree, The Staging Area</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">After fully understanding the three stages of a file in Git, committed, modified, staged, one must learn the three sections of Git, the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area.  The Git directory is where Git stores the data for oneâ€™s project.  This is often considered the most important part of Git as it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.  The working tree where one can see a single version of the project.  These files are often pulled from the compressed database in the Git directory placed on the tree to be edited or modified.   The staging area is a file, often in the Git directory, that stores the information about what will be committed next; many often refer to it as the index.  Again this information is very important to the class as it is necessary to understand when using Git.
